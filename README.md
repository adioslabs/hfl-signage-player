Getting Started / Installation
------------------------------

This project is cross-platform software, and as such it should be possible to
run it on any operating system that supports the software listed in the
"Install" step, including, but not limited to: GNU/Linux, BSD, Microsoft
Windows, and macOS.

### Steps

1. Install:
   - Run-time environment:
     - Node.js 8.x
       - (Recommended) Install using [Node Version Manager (NVM)] (or its
         [Windows-equivalents]).
   - Web browser:
     - Mozilla Firefox (latest) \
       or
     - Chromium / Google Chrome (latest)
2. Open a command-line in the root of the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start`.
   - The command-line will automatically open Front-end and Management UI in
     your default browser and indicate where they can be opened in localhost and
     on your network.
   - To change the ports of the subprojects, see their documentations.
5. Go to Management UI, and create some signs, playlists, and (optionally)
   upload some files.
6. Go to Front-end, and open a playlist.

**Note:** You can also run the subprojects individually by running the commands
in the roots of their directories.
