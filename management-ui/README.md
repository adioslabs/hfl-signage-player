With this web app you can create HTML signs that show products and such, upload
files (like images and videos) that you can attach to those signs, and create
playlists â€“ collections of signs that are shown in sequence.

**Note:** All the work you do is autosaved. Your changes only show up in
[Front-end](../front-end/) once you refresh the page in it. Autosaving cannot be
turned off in this version.

This app was created with [Create React App](./CREATE-REACT-APP-README.md).
